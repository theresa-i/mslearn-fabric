# Create an ontology (preview) with Fabric IQ

In this lab, you'll create a complete Fabric IQ ontology for a fictitious healthcare company by manually building each component—entity types, properties, keys, relationships, and data bindings. The sample data includes facilities, departments, rooms, individuals, and medical equipment.

This lab takes approximately **40-45** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: You need a [Microsoft Fabric trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) to complete this exercise. You'll also need to enable the following [tenant settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/iq/ontology/overview-tenant-settings):
> - **Enable Ontology item (preview)**
> - **User can create Graph (preview)**

## Create a workspace

Before working with ontologies in Fabric, you need a workspace with a Fabric capacity.

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Fabric home page](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric) at `https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric` in a browser, and sign in with your Fabric credentials.
1. In the menu bar on the left, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks similar to &#128455;).
1. Create a new workspace with a name of your choice, selecting a licensing mode in one of the following workspace types: *Fabric*, *Fabric Trial*, or *Power BI Premium*.
1. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.

## Create a lakehouse with sample data

Now you'll create a lakehouse and load hospital operations data that will form the basis of your ontology.

1. In your workspace, select **+ New item** > **Lakehouse**.
1. Name the lakehouse `LamnaHealthcareLH` and select **Create**.
1. When the lakehouse opens, you'll upload CSV files and convert them to tables.

### Upload and load the hospital data files

You'll download all sample data files, upload five CSV files to the lakehouse containing entity data for hospitals, departments, rooms, patients, and vital sign monitors, then convert each file to a table.

1. Download all sample CSV files from the [course repository sample-data folder](../sample-data/):
   - **Hospitals.csv** - Healthcare facilities in your network
   - **Departments.csv** - Hospital departments (ICU, Emergency, Surgical)
   - **Rooms.csv** - Individual rooms within departments
   - **Patients.csv** - Current patients and their room assignments
   - **VitalSignEquipment.csv** - Monitoring equipment assigned to patients (which patient is being monitored, and when monitoring started)
   - **VitalSignsReadings.csv** - Actual patient vital sign measurements (heart rate, oxygen levels) collected over time from the monitors

1. Upload the five lakehouse files:
   - In the lakehouse, select **Upload files** from the main view
   - Browse to and select these five files: **Hospitals.csv**, **Departments.csv**, **Rooms.csv**, **Patients.csv**, **VitalSignEquipment.csv**
   - Select **Open**
   - Select **Upload** to upload all five files at once
   - Wait for the upload to complete
   
   > **Note**: You'll upload VitalSignsReadings.csv to an eventhouse later, not to the lakehouse.

1. Convert each uploaded file to a table:
   - In **Explorer**, select the **Files** folder, where you should see all five CSV files
   - For each file, select the **ellipsis (...)** to the right of the file name
   - Select **Load to Tables** > **New table**
   - Configure the table:
     - **Table name**: Use the file name without extension in lowercase (e.g., `hospitals`, `departments`, `rooms`, `patients`, `vitalsignequipment`)
     - **Column header**: Check **Use header for column names**
     - **Separator**: Leave as comma (`,`)
   - Select **Load**
   - Repeat this process for all five files

1. Verify you have five tables in the **Tables** section: `hospitals`, `departments`, `rooms`, `patients`, and `vitalsignequipment` as shown in the image below.

     ![Screenshot showing lakehouse Tables section with five tables: hospitals, departments, rooms, patients, and vitalsignequipment](Images/23-lakehouse-tables-complete.png)

## Create an eventhouse with streaming data

Next, you'll create an eventhouse to store real-time vital signs data that you'll bind to the ontology later.

1. In your workspace, select **+ New item** > **Eventhouse**.
1. Name the eventhouse `LamnaHealthcareEH` and select **Create**.
1. A default KQL database is created with the same name. Select the KQL database to open it.

### Ingest vital signs data

1. In the KQL database, select **Get data** > **Local file**.
1. In the **Select or create a destination table** section, select **+ New table** and enter `VitalSignsReadings` as the table name.
1. Under **Add up to 1,000 files**, select **Browse for files** and upload the VitalSignsReadings.csv file you downloaded earlier.
1. Select **Next**, then continue through the ingestion wizard, keeping the default settings.
1. Select **Finish** to complete the ingestion.
1. Verify the **VitalSignsReadings** table appears in the KQL database.

   Your KQL database should now show the VitalSignsReadings table:

   ![Screenshot showing KQL database with VitalSignsReadings table](Images/23-eventhouse-vitalsigns-table.png)

## Create an ontology

Now you'll create an empty ontology and build it step by step.

1. In your workspace, select **+ New item** > **Ontology (preview)**.
1. Name the ontology `LamnaHealthcareOntology` and select **Create**.
1. The ontology canvas opens, empty and ready for you to build your data model.

## Create entity types

You'll create five entity types representing the healthcare domain. Follow the detailed steps for the first entity type to learn the process, then use the reference table to create the remaining four.

### Create Hospital entity type

1. In the ontology ribbon, select **Add entity type**.
1. Enter **Hospital** as the entity type name and select **Add Entity Type**.
1. The Hospital entity type appears on the canvas.
1. With the Hospital entity type selected, go to the **Entity type configuration** pane on the right.
1. Select the **Properties** tab, then select **Add properties**.
1. Add each property by entering the details below and selecting **+ Add** after each one:

   | Property Name | Data Type | Property Type |
   |---------------|-----------|---------------|
   | HospitalId | Integer | Static |
   | HospitalName | String | Static |
   | City | String | Static |
   | State | String | Static |

1. After adding all properties, select **Save**.

1. Now you need to define an entity key. An entity key is a property that uniquely identifies each instance of the entity type. For hospitals, each hospital has a unique HospitalId, so this will be the key.
   
   Select **Key: Add entity type key** and choose **HospitalId** as the key, select **Save**.

### Create remaining entity types

Follow the same process to create these four additional entity types with their properties and keys:

| Entity Type | Property Name | Data Type | Property Type | Entity Type Key |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Department** | `DepartmentId`<br>`DepartmentName`<br>`HospitalId`<br>`Floor` | Integer<br>String<br>Integer<br>Integer | Static<br>Static<br>Static<br>Static | DepartmentId |
| **Room** | `RoomId`<br>`RoomNumber`<br>`DepartmentId`<br>`RoomType` | Integer<br>String<br>Integer<br>String | Static<br>Static<br>Static<br>Static | RoomId |
| **Patient** | `PatientId`<br>`FirstName`<br>`LastName`<br>`DateOfBirth`<br>`AdmissionDate`<br>`CurrentRoomId` | Integer<br>String<br>String<br>DateTime<br>DateTime<br>Integer | Static<br>Static<br>Static<br>Static<br>Static<br>Static | PatientId |
| **VitalSignEquipment** | `EquipmentId`<br>`PatientId`<br>`EquipmentType`<br>`MonitoringStartDate` | String<br>Integer<br>String<br>DateTime | Static<br>Static<br>Static<br>Static | EquipmentId |

You now have five entity types with properties and keys defined.  Verify that the Entity Types pane shows all five entity types, and that properties and entity type key have been defined for each entity:

   ![Screenshot showing Entity Types pane on left with five entity types listed: Hospital, Department, Room, Patient, VitalSignEquipment](Images/23-entity-types-complete.png)

## Create relationship types

Now, you'll create relationship types that model the healthcare entity relationships and vital sign monitoring: Hospital → Department → Room → Patient, with VitalSignEquipment monitoring Patient. Follow the detailed steps for the first relationship, then use the reference table to create the remaining three.

### Create Hospital-Department relationship

1. In the ribbon, select **Add relationship**.
1. In the **Add relationship type to ontology** dialog, configure:
   - **Relationship type name**: `contains`
   - **Source entity type**: `Hospital`
   - **Target entity type**: `Department`
1. Select **Add relationship type**.

The Contains relationship line appears on the canvas connecting Hospital to Department. You'll configure the data source later.

### Create remaining relationships

Follow the same process to create these four additional relationships:

| Relationship Name | Source Entity Type | Target Entity Type | Meaning |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **has** | Department | Room | Departments have rooms |
| **assignedTo** | Patient | Room | Patients are assigned to rooms |
| **monitors** | VitalSignEquipment | Patient | Vital sign equipment monitors patients |

   Your ontology canvas should look similar to the image below. Depending on canvas layout and which entities are selected, you may need to pan or zoom to view all entity types and relationship lines.

   ![Screenshot showing ontology canvas with entity types and relationship connections](Images/23-manual-ontology-structure.png)

Your ontology structure is complete. Now you need to bind entity properties to actual data sources.

## Bind entity types to data

So far, you've defined the schema of your ontology—entity types with properties and keys—but these are just empty templates. To make the ontology functional, you must bind each entity type to actual data sources. This tells Fabric where to find the real healthcare data that will populate your ontology.

You'll bind static data from lakehouse tables to four entities, then add both static and time-series bindings to the VitalSignEquipment entity.

### Bind Hospital entity

1. Select the **Hospital** entity type on the canvas.
1. In the **Entity type configuration** pane, go to the **Bindings** tab.
1. Select **Add data to entity type**.
1. In the **OneLake catalog**, select **LamnaHealthcareLH** (lakehouse) from your workspace.
1. Select **Connect**.
1. Select the **hospitals** table and select **Next**.
1. For **Binding type**, keep **Static**.
1. Under **Bind your properties**, map each property to its corresponding column:
   - HospitalId → HospitalId
   - HospitalName → HospitalName
   - City → City
   - State → State

   The system usually auto-maps when names match.

1. Select **Save**.

### Bind Department, Room, and Patient entities

Follow the same binding process for these three entities, which only require static data bindings. The system automatically maps columns to properties when names match—just verify the mappings are correct.

| Entity Type | Table Name | Source Columns |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Department** | departments | `DepartmentId`<br>`DepartmentName`<br>`HospitalId`<br>`Floor` |
| **Room** | rooms | `RoomId`<br>`RoomNumber`<br>`DepartmentId`<br>`RoomType` |
| **Patient** | patients | `PatientId`<br>`FirstName`<br>`LastName`<br>`DateOfBirth`<br>`AdmissionDate`<br>`CurrentRoomId` |

### Bind VitalSignEquipment entity

The VitalSignEquipment entity requires two data bindings: one for static equipment attributes and one for time-series measurements. Time-series bindings require static bindings first. Here's why—look at what each data source contains:

**VitalSignEquipment.csv** (Lakehouse - Static attributes):
```
EquipmentId | PatientId | EquipmentType           | MonitoringStartDate
VS-1001     | 1001      | Continuous Monitoring   | 2026-02-01
VS-1002     | 1002      | Continuous Monitoring   | 2026-02-01
```

**VitalSignsReadings.csv** (Eventhouse - Time-series measurements):
```
ReadingId | EquipmentId | Timestamp            | HeartRate | OxygenSaturation | RespiratoryRate
1         | VS-1001     | 2026-02-02T08:00:00Z | 78        | 98               | 16
2         | VS-1001     | 2026-02-02T08:05:00Z | 82        | 97               | 18
4         | VS-1002     | 2026-02-02T08:00:00Z | 92        | 99               | 14
```

Notice the time-series data only has measurements and EquipmentId—not patient or equipment type. The static binding creates the equipment entities with full context (VS-1001 is Continuous Monitoring equipment tracking Patient 1001), and the time-series binding attaches streaming measurements to those entities using EquipmentId as the matching key.

#### Bind static monitor reference data

1. Select the **VitalSignEquipment** entity type.
1. In the **Bindings** tab, select **Add data to entity type**.
1. In the **OneLake catalog**, select **LamnaHealthcareLH** (lakehouse) from your workspace.
1. Select **Connect**.
1. Select the **vitalsignequipment** table and select **Next**.
1. Keep **Static** binding type.
1. Map the properties to columns (should auto-map):
   - EquipmentId → EquipmentId
   - PatientId → PatientId
   - EquipmentType → EquipmentType
   - MonitoringStartDate → MonitoringStartDate
1. Select **Save**.

#### Bind time-series vital signs data

Now you'll add real-time vital signs readings as time-series properties.

1. With VitalSignEquipment still selected, in the **Bindings** tab, select **Add data to entity type** again.
1. In the **OneLake catalog**, select **LamnaHealthcareEH** (eventhouse) from your workspace.
1. Select **Connect**.
1. Select the **VitalSignsReadings** table and select **Next**.
1. For **Binding type**, select **Time series**.
2. For **Source data timestamp column** select `Timestamp`

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Time-series bindings require a matching key from static data. You must have the static binding configured first (which you just did).

3. Configure the time-series binding:
   - **Static section** - Maps the key to link streaming data to entities:
     - Select **EquipmentId** as the column that connects streaming readings to equipment entities
     - This matches the EquipmentId column from your static binding
   
   - **Time series section** - Map the properties to columns (should auto-map):
     - ReadingId → ReadingId
     - Timestamp → Timestamp
     - HeartRate → HeartRate
     - OxygenSaturation → OxygenSaturation
     - RespiratoryRate → RespiratoryRate

   Your time-series binding configuration should look like this:

   ![Screenshot showing time-series binding configuration with static key and time-series properties](Images/23-timeseries-binding-vitalsigns.png)

4. Select **Save** to save the time-series binding.

Your VitalSignEquipment entity now has both static reference data (which monitors are where) and time-series data (actual vital sign readings over time).

All five entity types now have data bindings connecting their properties to data sources.

## Configure relationships

Now you'll configure each relationship type by specifying which table links the entity instances together. First you'll configure one relationship using the details below, then use the reference table for the remaining four.

### Configure Hospital-Department relationship

1. On the ontology canvas, select the **Hospital** entity, then select  **contains** in the relationship line between Hospital and Department.
1. In the **Relationship configuration** pane on the right, configure the source data location:
   - **Workspace**: Select your workspace
   - **Lakehouse**: Select **LamnaHealthcareLH**
   - **Schema**: Select **dbo**
   - **Table**: Select **departments**
   
   > **Note**: The departments table works as the relationship source because it contains keys for both Hospital (HospitalId) and Department (DepartmentId). The hospitals table wouldn't work here because it only contains HospitalId.

1. Configure the entity type mappings by selecting columns that match the key properties defined on each entity:
   
   - Under **1. Source entity type**: Select **Hospital** (change from default if needed)
     - **Source column**: Select **HospitalId** (matches the HospitalId key defined on the Hospital entity)
   - Under **2. Target entity type**: Select **Department** (change from default if needed)
     - **Source column**: Select **DepartmentId** (matches the DepartmentId key defined on the Department entity)

   Your relationship configuration should look like this:

   ![Screenshot showing relationship configuration pane with workspace, lakehouse, and column mappings](Images/23-relationship-binding.png)

2. Select **Create**

### Configure remaining relationships

Follow the same process for the remaining four relationships. For each: select the relationship line on the canvas, configure the source data and column mappings in the Relationship configuration pane, and select **Create**.

| Relationship | Source Data | Source Entity Column | Target Entity Column |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **has** (Department → Room) | LamnaHealthcareLH > dbo > rooms | Department: DepartmentId | Room: RoomId |
| **assignedTo** (Patient → Room) | LamnaHealthcareLH > dbo > patients | Patient: PatientId | Room: CurrentRoomId |
| **monitors** (VitalSignEquipment → Patient) | LamnaHealthcareLH > dbo > vitalsignequipment | VitalSignEquipment: EquipmentId | Patient: PatientId |

All relationships now have source data configured. Your ontology understands the complete healthcare data model: hospitals contain departments, departments contain rooms, patients are assigned to rooms, and vital sign equipment monitors patients.

## Verify the ontology

Your ontology is now complete with entities, relationships, static data, and time-series data—all built manually from the ground up. Let's verify it works.

1. Select **Room** from the Entity Types list.
1. In the ontology ribbon, select **Entity type overview**.
1. You'll see an "Updating your ontology" message while the system processes your data in the background. After 1-2 minutes, refresh your browser to display the entity type overview.

   You'll see tiles showing:
   - **Relationship graph**: Visual representation of how this entity type connects to other entity types
   - **Property charts**: Bar charts showing the distribution of property values (like RoomType, RoomNumber, or DepartmentId)
   - **Entity instances table**: List of all individual room instances with their properties

   ![Screenshot showing Room entity type overview with relationship graph, property charts, and entity instances table](Images/23-entity-type-overview.png)

1. In the **Entity instances** table, select any room instance (for example, **ICU-302**).
1. The instance view opens, showing the properties for this specific room and its connections to other entities.

You've successfully built a complete ontology from the ground up—defining entity types, configuring relationships, binding data from both lakehouse tables and eventhouse streams, and creating a unified semantic layer. Your ontology now represents the healthcare domain with business vocabulary and connects operational data with real-time vital signs monitoring. This ontology is ready to power graph queries and AI agents.

## Clean up resources (optional)

You can keep this workspace and ontology to continue exploring Fabric IQ capabilities. If you want to remove the resources you created in this exercise, follow these steps:

1. In the bar on the left, select the icon for your workspace to view all of the items it contains.
1. Select **Workspace settings**.
1. In the **General** section, select **Remove this workspace**.
